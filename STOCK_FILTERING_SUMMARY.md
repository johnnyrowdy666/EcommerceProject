# Stock Filtering Implementation Summary

## Overview
Products with zero or negative stock are now automatically hidden from the home screen and general product listings to improve user experience and prevent showing unavailable items.

## Changes Made

### 1. Frontend Filtering (HomeScreen.js) âœ…
- **Location**: `frontend/src/screens/HomeScreen.js`
- **Change**: Added client-side filtering to remove products with `stock <= 0`
- **Benefit**: Immediate filtering on the frontend for better performance
- **Code**: 
```javascript
// Filter out products with zero or negative stock
const availableProducts = productsData.value.filter(product => 
  product.stock > 0
);
```

### 2. Backend API Filtering (server.js) âœ…
- **Location**: `backend/server.js`
- **Change**: Added `hideOutOfStock` parameter to `/api/products` endpoint
- **Default**: `hideOutOfStock=true` (hides out-of-stock products by default)
- **Override**: Can set `hideOutOfStock=false` to show all products
- **SQL Query**: Added `AND stock > 0` condition when filtering is enabled

### 3. Admin Access to All Products âœ…
- **New Endpoint**: `/api/admin/products`
- **Purpose**: Admins can see all products including out-of-stock ones
- **Use Case**: Inventory management and stock monitoring
- **Access**: Requires admin role authentication

### 4. Admin Dashboard Enhancement âœ…
- **Location**: `frontend/src/screens/AdminDashboard.js`
- **New Tab**: "Products" tab showing all products with stock status
- **Stock Indicators**: 
  - ðŸŸ¢ In Stock (stock > 5)
  - ðŸŸ¡ Low Stock (stock â‰¤ 5)
  - ðŸ”´ Out of Stock (stock â‰¤ 0)

## API Endpoints

### Public Endpoints
- `GET /api/products` - Shows only available products (stock > 0)
- `GET /api/products?hideOutOfStock=false` - Shows all products including out-of-stock

### Admin Endpoints
- `GET /api/admin/products` - Shows all products regardless of stock (admin only)

## Benefits

### For Users
- âœ… No more disappointment from seeing unavailable products
- âœ… Cleaner, more relevant product listings
- âœ… Better shopping experience

### For Admins
- âœ… Full inventory visibility including out-of-stock items
- âœ… Stock monitoring and management
- âœ… Ability to see what needs restocking

### For Business
- âœ… Improved user satisfaction
- âœ… Better inventory management
- âœ… Reduced customer service issues

## Stock Status Display

### Home Screen & Product Listings
- Only shows products with `stock > 0`
- Stock count displayed on each product card
- "Out of Stock" badge for products with `stock <= 0`

### Admin Dashboard
- Shows all products regardless of stock
- Color-coded stock indicators:
  - **Green**: In Stock (stock > 5)
  - **Yellow**: Low Stock (stock â‰¤ 5) 
  - **Red**: Out of Stock (stock â‰¤ 0)

## Implementation Details

### Frontend Filtering
```javascript
// HomeScreen.js
const availableProducts = productsData.value.filter(product => 
  product.stock > 0
);
setProducts(availableProducts);
setFeaturedProducts(availableProducts.slice(0, 6));
```

### Backend Filtering
```sql
-- Default behavior (hideOutOfStock=true)
SELECT * FROM products WHERE stock > 0 ORDER BY id DESC

-- Override behavior (hideOutOfStock=false)
SELECT * FROM products ORDER BY id DESC
```

### Stock Validation
- Stock is validated before adding to cart
- Stock is only reduced after successful payment
- Real-time stock updates prevent overselling

## Testing Scenarios

### 1. Normal User Experience
- [ ] Home screen shows only available products
- [ ] Out-of-stock products are completely hidden
- [ ] Product cards show current stock levels
- [ ] Add to cart button disabled for out-of-stock items

### 2. Admin Experience
- [ ] Admin dashboard shows all products
- [ ] Stock indicators are color-coded correctly
- [ ] Out-of-stock products are visible to admins
- [ ] Stock counts are accurate

### 3. API Behavior
- [ ] `/api/products` hides out-of-stock by default
- [ ] `/api/products?hideOutOfStock=false` shows all products
- [ ] `/api/admin/products` shows all products (admin only)

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
1. **Low Stock Alerts**: Notify admins when stock is low
2. **Restock Notifications**: Alert users when out-of-stock items are back
3. **Stock History**: Track stock changes over time
4. **Automated Restocking**: Set minimum stock thresholds

### Stock Management Features
1. **Bulk Stock Updates**: Update multiple products at once
2. **Stock Transfer**: Move stock between locations
3. **Stock Forecasting**: Predict future stock needs
4. **Supplier Integration**: Automatic restock orders

## Conclusion

The stock filtering implementation ensures that:
- **Users** only see available products
- **Admins** have full inventory visibility
- **Business** maintains accurate stock management
- **System** prevents overselling and improves user experience

This creates a win-win situation where customers have a better shopping experience while admins maintain full control over inventory management! ðŸŽ‰
