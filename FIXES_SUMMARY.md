# Fixes Summary - Navigation & Cart System

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Navigation Structure Issues âœ…
- **Problem**: `OnboardScreen` was not included in the navigation stack
- **Solution**: Fixed `App.js` to properly separate `AuthNavigator` and `AppNavigator`
- **Result**: Users can now properly navigate between authenticated and unauthenticated states

### 2. Missing API Functions âœ…
- **Problem**: `getMyOrders` function was referenced but didn't exist
- **Solution**: Updated `OrderScreen.js` to use `getOrders` function
- **Result**: Order screen now properly fetches and displays user orders

### 3. Cart System Implementation âœ…
- **Problem**: Cart was using mock data and had no real functionality
- **Solution**: 
  - Created `CartContext.js` for global cart state management
  - Updated `CartScreen.js` with real cart functionality
  - Added "Add to Cart" buttons to `ProductCard.js`
  - Integrated with `AsyncStorage` for persistence
- **Result**: Full cart functionality with add/remove/update quantities

### 4. Stock Management âœ…
- **Problem**: Stock was not properly managed during checkout
- **Solution**: 
  - Stock is only reduced after successful payment
  - Added stock validation before checkout
  - Backend properly handles stock updates
- **Result**: Stock is accurately maintained and only reduced on successful orders

### 5. Missing Screens âœ…
- **Problem**: Several screens were missing or incomplete
- **Solution**: 
  - Created `ProductsByCategory.js` screen
  - Improved `OrderScreen.js` with proper order display
